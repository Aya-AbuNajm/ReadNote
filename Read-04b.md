# Computer Architecture and Logic 

Computer architecture consists of rules and methods or procedures which describe the implementation, functionality of the computer systems.
 
 ## Ther is 4 part of a computer:
 * Input 
 * Memory 
 * CPU
 * Output

## How Computers Work?
* **Data & Binary**
 computers use **binary** - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. A binary digit, or bit.

 The circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors. A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives. The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor.
 > Binary read texts ,images and sound by numbers.

* **Circuits & Logic**
Combinational Logic Circuits are made up from basic logic NAND, NOR or NOT gates that are “combined” or connected together to produce more complicated switching circuits. These logic gates are the building blocks of combinational logic circuits.

## Input, Memory ,CPU and Output

Part   | WHAT DO 
------ |---------
CPU    |Central processing unit calculates information
input  |converts physical input to binary information
output | converts information physical output
Memory | stories information


## Hardware and Software
* **Computer hardware** is any physical device used in or with your machine, whereas software is a collection of codes installed onto your computer’s hard drive.

* **Computer Software** Word processing software uses the computer processor, memory, and hard drive to generate and save documents.
> software controls hardware

## Operating Systems (OS)
is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
