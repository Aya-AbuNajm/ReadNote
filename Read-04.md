# THE DOCUMENT OBJECT REPRESENTS AN HTML PAGE
 Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how hey interact with it.

## the document object has: 
* PROPERTIES 
 Properties describe characteristics of the current 
 web page.

* METHODS
Methods perform tasks associated with the 
document currently loaded in the browser
* EVENTS
You can respond to events, such as a user clicking or 
tapping on an element.

>In fact, the document object is just one of a set of 
objects that all major browsers support. When the 
browser creates a model of a web page, it not only 
creates a document object, but it also creates a 
new object for each element on the page.

## HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 
how a browser interprets the HTML code and applies tyling to it
1- RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE
2-: CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY
3-USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN 

>All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow.

![language](https://freshdesignweb.com/wp-content/uploads/site/CSS-SVG-Animated-Circles.jpg)
### HTML
html files This is where the content of the page lives.The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics. 

### CSS 
css files The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.). 

### JavaScript
This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files

> It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.

## Javascript 

* STATEMENTS 
>JavaScript is case sensitive so timeNow means something different to TimeNow or TIMENOW.

now if we would to talk about if statement it give a condition if it done it well do the statement if not it will out of the statement

* COMMENTS 
we can use // to write something we would not to share in user screen.

## Are you know WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
Variables help us to save specific data and numbers to facilitate their use and make it easier for us to perform mathematical operations and enter data in them.
Let's say, for example, that it is a storeg in which what is called is when we need it.

### RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 

* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an 
underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 
* All variables are case sensitive.
*The name can contain letters, numbers,But note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name. 
* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.
* If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
