# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

## what ?
group of statment to do something .

## why ?
The main advantage is code reusability. We can write a method once, and use it multiple times. We do not have to rewrite the entire code each time. Think of it as, "write once, reuse multiple times".

## How ?
by write it it

## kind of function 
* **Declaring a Function**

The syntax to declare a method is:
~~~
returnType methodName() {
  // method body
}
~~~
> Methods make code more readable and easier to debug.

* **Function Exception**
xceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of instructions (e.g. divide by zero, array access out of bound, etc.). In Java, an exception is an object that wraps an error event that occurred within a method and contains: Information about the error including its type.

## Calling a function

To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon; The process of method calling is simple. When a program invokes a method, the program control gets transferred to the called method



## Intro + Scripts

Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in rely on the ability to:
Access the content of the page
Modify the content of the page
Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
React to events triggered by the user or browser

> A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

1: DEFINE THE GOAL
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3: CODE EACH STEP

Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.

language and how it is used in web browsers.
 you need to get to grips with the:
â€¢ Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
Syntax: How you put those words together to

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
