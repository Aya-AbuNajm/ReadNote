# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

## what ?
group of statment to do something .

## why ?
The main advantage is code reusability. We can write a method once, and use it multiple times. We do not have to rewrite the entire code each time. Think of it as, "write once, reuse multiple times".

## How ?
by write it it

* **Declaring a Function**

The syntax to declare a method is:
~~~
returnType methodName() {
  // method body
}
~~~
> Methods make code more readable and easier to debug.

* **Function Exception**
xceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of instructions (e.g. divide by zero, array access out of bound, etc.). In Java, an exception is an object that wraps an error event that occurred within a method and contains: Information about the error including its type.

To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon; The process of method calling is simple. When a program invokes a method, the program control gets transferred to the called method
