# Text Editor

## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. 

## The most important features are:
1.) code completion;
2.) syntax
highlighting;
3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); 
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.
> There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine.

 why should you download yet another text editor that does essentially the same thing as the text editor that you already have? There are other text editors that have features that you may be interested in.


 ## Warnings to avoid when using the text editor that comes installed on the device:
* Plain text has no formatting options.
*  please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.
* your text editor won’t assist you in finding your mistakes.

## The Command Line!

is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

**The Shell, Bash**
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.

**Shortcuts**
The terminal may seem daunting but don't fret. Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier. You'll be introduced to several of them throughout this tutorial. Take note of them as not only do they make your life easier, they often also save you from making silly mistakes such as typos.

## Basic Navigation!

* The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of  ommands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or  ords describing them. This makes it easier to remember  hem.) The command does just that. It tells you what your  urrent or present working directory is. Give it a try now.


* To begin with, we have to understand that the file system under linux is a hierarchical structure. At the very top of the structure is what's called the root directory. It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on. Files may reside in any of these directories.

* Everything is a File
Ok, the first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.
